    # For E2E, we need to start the server. 
    # Since we don't have a standardized "start-all" script yet, we might skip E2E for this iteration 
    # OR we use a service container/background process.
    # Let's try running the backend in background, then frontend, then test.
    # For now, let's keep it simple: Backend Tests + Build Verification.
    # We will enable full E2E in CI later once we have a mock DB strategy for full system.
